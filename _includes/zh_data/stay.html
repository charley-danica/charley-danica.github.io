                    Novi Sad has plenty of options—hotels, apartments, and guesthouses—at a range of budgets. Below are a few tips to help you choose the best area and book easily.

                            <strong>Best areas to base yourself:</strong> The city center (Stari Grad) is the most walkable for restaurants and nightlife. The area near the Danube is great for scenic walks. If you prefer something quieter, look just outside the center and use taxis to get around.

                            <strong>Types of stays:</strong> Apartments (short-term rentals) are very common and can be great for groups. Hotels offer the most convenience, while smaller guesthouses can be a cozy, budget-friendly option.

                            <strong>Booking tip:</strong> If your travel dates overlap with festivals, summer weekends, or big events, prices can rise and places fill up quickly—booking earlier is usually best.

                            <strong>Getting around:</strong> Novi Sad is compact, and taxis are typically an easy way to get to/from the venue. Staying centrally usually means shorter rides and more flexibility.
